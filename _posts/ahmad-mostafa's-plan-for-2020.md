## Happy New Year

I know some people think that it is kind of ridiculous practice to put plans based on a the new year, yeah I think that if you want to change you can start anytime, I was setting my plans daily, but now I will try to set some goals for 2020, and I am going to force myself to stay committed to them as much as I can.

## 5 goals to achieve in 2020

### Being an AWS (Amazon Web Services) certified

I am planning to be an [AWS Certified Solutions Architect â€“ Associate](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate/)
by passing the exam, I feel comfortable right now using AWS for various cloud services, but I want to be more confident creating high-available, resilient, scalable, well architected Web services.

I have been using AWS for more than 18 month, but I am trying to sharp my skills by enrolling in some good courses, and by reading some books beside the hands-on practicing.

If you are curious about those courses and books here I will list some of them, and if you know better ones please throw them on the comments section down below.

- [Ultimate AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate 2020](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-saa-c01/) By Stephane Maarek
- [Amazon Web Services AWS LiveLessons 2nd Edition](https://learning.oreilly.com/videos/amazon-web-services/9780135581247) By Richard Jones
- [AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate All-in-One Exam Guide](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/aws-certified-solutions/9781260108262/)

### Improving my written and spoken English

I already started improving my english proficiency, and this blog is one of the forms of doing so, I feel comfortable understanding spoken English, but I want to increase my vocabulary so I can express my thoughts in a better way, I am practicing by reading as much as I can of well written books, and for the Vocabulary I use an awesome mobile app called [WordUp Vocabulary](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.wordupapp.app&hl=en) it is really useful and enjoyable, I try to use it before I get to sleep, and during my transportation.

### Publishing a good open-source side project

I will publish a web app called [Friday Souq](https://github.com/arab-open-source/friday-souq) I just kicked off this project, the main purpose is to master [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), (AWS)[<https://aws.amazon.com/]> in an Open-Source environment trying to get some contributions, to get more knowledge of open-source practices.

### Contributing to existing open-source projects

I will try to hunt some Github issues in projects that have my interest, I am thinking of Vue.js or eco-systems, because I find them fun, and because there is a lot to learn in such open-source communities.

### Build better digital footprint

I am thinking about 3 fields I will develop to improve my digital footprint

- Improving my website first by writing more useful articles periodically, adding more features, and improving SEO
- Contributing to [StackOverFLow](https://stackoverflow.com/) by trying to answer some questions in my free time.
- Posting coding tutorials in my [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8fZybVYhEnCe1UwwVidVcg)
