## Why I started doing open-source work everyday

Practice makes perfect, I was practicing everyday to be a better programmer, but most of these practices were lost, do you know why? because I was practicing alone, with a small apps that is nobody ever gonna use, I said why don't I make something that is really useful, something that other people can use, and contribute to.

[npmjs](https://www.npmjs.com/) package manager now while I am writing this post has about 1,154,793 module! all of them have been done by passionates, and generous programers who love to share knowledge!
those modules added a lot of power to the tech world! no need to reinvent the wheel, everything is out there!

I started by publishing my own website vuepress theme, I called it [vuepress-theme-modern-blog](https://github.com/z3by/vuepress-theme-modern-blog) and people really liked it, I got a good feedback about it, so I continued developing it by adding more features, and enhancing the design everyday.

## Creating [Arab open-source community](https://github.com/arab-open-source)

2 weeks ago I created this community and invited some of my best developers fellows to join me contributing to this community so we grow and learn together, the motive to create such a community is to keep myself close to my fellows while building things the improves the Arabic content, and because I can not do great things alone.

## [Arab open-source community](https://github.com/arab-open-source) Ÿêearly projects

### [vue-themify-icons](https://github.com/arab-open-source/vue-themify-icons)

A small and light-weight npm package for [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) that let you use [Themify free icons](https://themify.me/themify-icons) in [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) apps, I liked the icons package because it designed to be clean, light and aesthetic, so I wanted it to be available in vue.js app easily.

### [vuepress-theme-material](https://github.com/arab-open-source/vuepress-theme-material)

A [vuepress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/) theme that adheres to the [Material design](https://material.io/design/), I decided to create this package because I wanted to combine the awesomeness of [Material design](https://material.io/design/) with the incredible [vuepress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/) to create a great documentation sites.

### [](https://github.com/arab-open-source/mostamal)

A web app that meant to be free, and open-source for selling or buying used stuff online, I am actually more into [Vuejs](https://vuejs.org/) but I [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) is a very  popular javascript framework, so we might get more contributions if we used it.

## What is next

Now I am planning to work at least 10 hours each week on improving this community, and making things that other developers likes to use and contribute to.
