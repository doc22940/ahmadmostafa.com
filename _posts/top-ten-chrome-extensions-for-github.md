GitHub is already great and no developer can live without it, lets add some chrome extensions to make it even greater!

## Octotree

> Browser extension that brings your GitHub experience to the next level.

I like this extension so much! it lets you explore the files and folders of a repository with a tree like the one in VS Code!

## Better Pull Request

> Make GitHub Pull Requests better with a file tree view and other UX improvements

When I want to see file changes on a pull request I get lost all the time, and I need to search for a specific file with the browser search, but with this extension you can browse the changed files with a tree like VS code! really cool.

## GitHub Dark

> Dark GitHub style

Who doesn't like dark themes? make Github UI and code go dark with various great themes!

NOTE: this is a user style for StylishThemes, there is a standalone extension named Github dark but I prefer this one because it is more customizable, check out the details in the GitHub repo.
